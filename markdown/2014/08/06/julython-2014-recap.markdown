[Julython](http://www.julython.org/) 2014 has come and gone. I hope everyone had a blast, I know I did!

## A Month of Hacking In a Nutshell

Let's take a quick look into what was worked on in July:

 - [Learned SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/drincruz/sqlalchemy-tutorial)
 - Worked on my [Slidedecker](https://github.com/drincruz/slidedecker) app
 - Forked and contributed to `[bump](https://github.com/drincruz/bump)`
 - Published another pypi module: [MPPyResponse](https://github.com/drincruz/Monty-Python-PyResponse)

 ## An Opportunity to Learn, Build

I like to use Julython as a very good excuse to learn something new or learn something more about. In this passed July's case, I have been toying with the idea of learning SQLAlchemy, and this was a perfect excuse to do so.

Take a look at my [Slidedecker repository](https://github.com/drincruz/slidedecker) and you will see that I added SQLAlchemy to it. Obviously, I wanted to learn more about it first, so I also added the tutorial to my Julython projects. But I really wanted to learn by example, so obviously working on your own personal project is the way to go!

## PyPI Contributions

Both `bump` and `MPPyResponse` are packages available on PyPI.

`bump` is a fork of the original that I use to do version bumping. I had a need to do version bumping for release candidates or beta candidates and that functionality was missing, so I added that in.

`MPPyResponse` was created out of sheer humor. A friend of mine jokingly asked me to create an application that responded with a random Monty Python quote; no problem!

Obviously, with it still being Julython, I wanted to learn something new while still having fun, so with `MPPyResponse`, I started that project off with [cookiecutter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cookiecutter/0.6.4). It is truly a fantastic little package for starting off your own little package. I highly recommend it if you need a little boilerplate to get your projects going!

## Summary

In summation, Julython for me is really just an excuse to learn something new in Python while having a little fun. Yes, sharing code and watching myself on the leader board are awesome too, but all in all, contributing to a month-long event of hacking is really just a wonderful thing!

Until next time! Cheers!
