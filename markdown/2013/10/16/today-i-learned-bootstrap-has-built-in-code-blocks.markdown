I was thinking about how I was going to handle sharing code on this site. While I can surely use a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/drincruz), it is obviously not ideal for sharing small snippets of code.

So for example: `This is code`. No, that really wasn't code, but you get the point!

To use it, just use: `<code>{your_code_here}</code>` Look at that, I got to show another example! ;)
