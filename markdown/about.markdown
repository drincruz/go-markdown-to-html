# About

> Hi, I'm Adrian Cruz. I am an engineer, I build things.

I am not big on titles, but I am a senior individual contributor. I am an engineer, I build things. I am a big Linux and opensource user. I write code in whatever language that fits the job. That being said, I like to keep myself up-to-date with technology and am always looking to learn more.

I believe in diversity, inclusion, mentorship & sponsorship, and having a growth mindset.

## Quick Fun Q&A

### What is one book that had a big influence on you?

[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams). I am an engineer, but that does not mean I am a machine. The people-side of software engineering is often the most complex.


### What is a food that you like that everyone seems to dislike?

Durian. I mean, yes, it has a _smell_ to it, but the flavour is delightful. It's the king of fruits!

### If you could have any superpower, what would it be?

I would have to say, invisibility. This is a bit of a double-edged sword; at times I do like visibility and understand its importance, but honestly, there are a lot of times where I would just love to get some quiet time in!
